# M:2:I Design Review Template
The LaTeX and PowerPoint files are for use by students enrolled in Make to Innovate and for their mid-term design reviews.  Only these templates may be used by students to fullfill their design review requirements in M:2:I.  
# Using the templates
Students should concentrate on on their content and not the formatting of the presentation since that has been done for you.  In fact modification to the template may result in a reduced grade.  Students should are encouraged to add additional slides.  The slides provided are meant as a starting point and as a minimum requirement for amount of material that is to be presented.
# Submission
Students submitting their Design Review slides need to do so using the assignment given in Blackboard.  Students must name the files in the following format:  Team-name_LastName-team-leader_semester-of-presentation.pdf or .pptx.  For example, HABET_Smith_Spring15.pdf
